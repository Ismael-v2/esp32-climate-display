# ESP32 Climate Display
## A temperature and humidity monitor that displays real-time values

### This climate display works by using a few key components: 
- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306)
- 400 Tie-Point Breadboard (Any breadboard should be sufficient)

### How it works:
By utilizing the ESP32 and additional components, it is able to gather readings every 2 seconds from the DHT11 sensor and print those collected values onto the 0.96" OLED display.
